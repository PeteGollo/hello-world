	<h1>Tags we have already used</h1>
	
	
	
	<ul>
	<li>  <b> &lt;!doctype&gt; </b> <em> - This tag is special.  Document Type Declaration.  Unlike most tags, it has no closing tag, not even a "/" at the end.  It is there to declare exactly what type of HTML the computer will find in this file.  </em>
	
    <li>  <b>  &lt;html&gt;  </b> - The <b>  html  </b> open and close tags wrap around nearly everything in your html file (except the doctype tag).  This essentially contains all of the HTML code in the file, which is generally everything (one big html element). </li>
    
    <li>  <b>  &lt;head&gt;  </b> - The <b>  head  </b> element is where you put information that does not really appear in the body of the work.  For example, the  <b>   &lt;title&gt;  </b> of the page, which typically appears on the window containing the page, is defined in the head section.</li>
		
    <li>  <b>  &lt;body&gt;  </b> - The  <b>  body  </b> section contains all of the content of your page, essentially what the user sees.  This could be text, pictures, links, videos, tables and so on.  In addition to the content, the body usually contains lots of other elements, each indicated by their own tags.</li>
	
    <li>  <b>  &lt;h1&gt;  </b> - There are a whole collection of '<b>  h  </b>' tags, <b>  &lt;h1&gt;  </b>,  <b>  &lt;h2&gt;  </b>,  <b>  &lt;h3&gt;  </b> . . . all the way up to <b>  &lt;h6&gt;  </b>.  They're generally used the same way you would use chapter or section headings in a book (<em>  don't confuse the h here with the  </em> <b> &lt;head&gt; </b> <em>  section, that is completely different  </em>).  An <b>  &lt;h1&gt;  </b> tag might be used as the title of the document (<em>as it appears on the page, not the same as the aforementioned </em> <b>  &lt;title&gt;  </b>  <em> element</em>), or to indicate the outermost level in a group of nested sections.  </li>
    
    <li>  <b>  &lt;p&gt;  </b> - <b> P </b> is for '<b> paragraph </b> ', which is how much of your text information might be arranged.  Depending on the style you are using, text wrapped in a <b> &lt;p&gt; </b> tag may be indented or have extra vertical white space before starting.  When rendered on the web page, a p element will typically be a new line.</li> 
    </ul>
